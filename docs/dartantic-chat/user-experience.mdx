The `AgentChatView` widget is the entry point for the interactive chat
experience. Hosting an instance enables these features automatically:

* **Multiline text input**: Paste long text or insert new lines
* **Voice input**: Input prompts using speech
* **Multimedia input**: Take pictures, send images, attach files and URLs
* **Slash commands**: Type `/` to open a command menu with filtering and keyboard
  navigation
* **Image zoom**: Tap thumbnails to zoom
* **Copy to clipboard**: Copy message text
* **Paste from clipboard**: Paste text or images from the clipboard
* **Message editing**: Edit the most recent message
* **Material and Cupertino**: Adapts to both design languages

## Multiline Text Input

Submitting prompts:
* **Mobile**: Tap the **Submit** button
* **Web/Desktop**: Press **Enter** or tap the **Submit** button

Embedding newlines:
* **Mobile**: Tap Return key on the virtual keyboard
* **Web/Desktop**: Press `Shift+Enter`

## Voice Input

Tap the **Mic** button (visible when no text entered) to start recording. Select
**Stop** to translate voice input to text, which can then be edited and
submitted.

## Multimedia Input

Select the **Plus** button to choose from **Take Photo**, **Image Gallery**,
**Attach File**, and **Attach Link** options.

## Image Zoom

Tap an image thumbnail to zoom. Press **Esc** or tap outside to dismiss.

## Copy to Clipboard

On desktop/web, select text to copy, or use the **Copy** button on hover. On
mobile, long-tap a message and choose Copy.

## Pasting from Clipboard

Users can paste content using standard keyboard shortcuts or context menus:

- **Text**: Paste formatted or plain text
- **Images**: Paste images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, etc.)

The input field automatically detects content type and adds images/files as
attachments.

<Note> On some platforms, you may need to grant clipboard access permissions for
paste functionality to work with certain content types. See the [clipboard
access](/dartantic-chat/getting-started#clipboard-access) section for more information.</Note>

## Message Editing

On desktop, tap the **Edit** button alongside **Copy** for your most recent
prompt. On mobile, long-tap and select **Edit**.

## Slash Commands

Type `/` at the start of the input or after a space to open the command menu. The
menu appears anchored to the text caret position and supports:

* **Filtering**: Continue typing after `/` to narrow the list (e.g., `/hel`
  filters to commands containing "hel")
* **Keyboard navigation**: Use **Up/Down** arrow keys to move between items and
  **Enter** to select
* **Mouse selection**: Click any item to trigger it

The command menu closes automatically when the `/` trigger is removed (e.g., by
pressing backspace) or when a command is selected. Selecting a command removes
the slash text from the input and executes the command's action.

See [Feature Integration](/dartantic-chat/feature-integration#custom-commands)
for how to define your own commands.

## Material and Cupertino

`AgentChatView` supports both Material and Cupertino apps. Theming is controlled
via the `style` property.
